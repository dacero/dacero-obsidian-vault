### 2024-04-28@19:05 - Creating the repo in GitHub

- [x] Create the repo in GitHub
	- Already created at 19:11 

### 2024-04-28@12:07 - Creating a frame for the notes use case

- [x] Create a skeleton for the notes section
	- This is going to need some thinking
	- Well, it's now 18:42, after some hiatus I've finished with a minimal setup.
	- Just two notes categories:
		- [[Notes]] - will include evergreen notes.
		- [[Captures]] - will include any other note that stems from a source.

### 2024-04-28@11:29 - Finishing project methodology

- 11:29 Complete the description of the `sessions`.
- [x] Finish describing the process to manage projects in [[Readme]].
- [x] Create a [[Projects]] page showing all existing projects
	- It requires the `Dataview` pluginâ€¦ installed.
	- Had to learn to format the date with `dateformat()`, good result:
	- ![[projects screenshot.png]]
	- The status looks better with an emoji. I now need to create a list of potential status here.
	- Now I need to understand where to leave all the `categories`. Kepano uses a dedicated folder for that. Let's apply the same logic. Should it be the `1-categories` or the `7-categories`?
		- I think it's more the 7, in the sense that it's part of the meta structure of the vault.
		- Now I'm thinking that I might have to create 90, 91, 92 as META folders. Yes, updated to have the 9X as META folders.
- [x] Create a list of emojis with the potential project status

### 2024-04-28@08:50 - Project creation

- Project was created
- [x] Include kepano's url in the box
- [x] Fix the date in the project template.
