## Active projects and posts
```dataview
table 
	dateformat(created, "MMM yyyy") as Created,
	category as Category,
	status as Status
where
	(contains(category,[[Projects]]) or 
	contains(category,[[Posts]])) and
	!contains(file.name,"Template") and
	contains(status, "ðŸŸ¢")
sort year desc
```

Daily notes are created with the [[Daily Template]].

It includes a reminder of active [[Projects]]. This way, before letting the day take over the agenda, I can reflect on what needs to be done to make progress on them.

This is a daily note, ready to capture some *fleeting notes*.
