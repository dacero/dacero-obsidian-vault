## What is this?

It's a template Obsidian vault structure that replicates how I use this tool for:

- Personal project management
- Note taking

## Root folder structure 

- `0-inbox`: default location for new notes.
- `1-projects`: project execution. 
- `2-notes`: flat folder with all notes.
- `90-categories`: contains hubs per category (pages with a dataview index of pages for a particular category)
- `91-templates`: template files all end with " Template".
- `92-assets`: location of attachments.

Order files by name.
## How to use the vault

There are 2 use cases:

- Project execution 
- Note taking

They are both in the same vault because there's some symbiosis between the two: projects feed from notes and viceversa.

### Project execution

The fundamental objectives that I'm pursuing are:

- **Perspective**: know all projects currently in execution.
- **Focus**: limit the work in progress.
- **Clarity**: always know what to do next.
- **Sense of Progress**: build momentum through visible small increments.

Every project has a folder.

Every project has a `project note` , with the same name as the project, created through the [[Project Template]].

Projects can be in one of these status:

- üü¢ - active
- ‚ö™Ô∏è - backlog (waiting to be executed)
- ‚òëÔ∏è - done
- üÖøÔ∏è - parked (not interested in exploring this now)

The `project hub` contains:

- **Target**: a tangible description of what I need to deliver.
- **Project Box**: a catch-all space for references, links, whatever.
- **Next Up**: what do I need to do next.
- **Journal**: a log of the progress of the project.

The journal is comprised by `sessions`, blocks of time dedicated to a simple objective.

Sessions have their own template, [[Session Template]]. I like to write the objective of the session in the title. Then all the details are written as a bullet list (an inherited practice from my logseq/roam days). Profusely use timestamps.

### Note taking

The vault contains many different types of notes:

- Fleeting notes
- Evergreen notes
- Book highlights
- Annotated articles | videos | podcasts 
- Restaurant reviews
- Movie reviews
- ‚Ä¶

This list can grow over time to reflect new categories.

Fleeting notes are captured in the `daily notes` in the `0-inbox`.

The rest of notes lie flat in the `2-notes` folder, with no structure underneath.

Each note under `2-notes` belong to a defined category and conforms to the correspoding template.

- [[Notes]]
- [[Captures]]

Each of these notes have the property `topics` so that we can create a number of different topics of interest. 

For commonly consulted topics, create a dedicated page in `3-references` using the [[Topics Template]] and it will list all pages.
